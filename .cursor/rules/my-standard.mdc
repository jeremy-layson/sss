# When asked to create an `API RESOURCE`, perform the following steps:
- Create a model and a migration file using the `artisan make:model -m` command
- Generate the columns and their data types and parameters based on the given table structure
- Add these columns to the `$fillable` property of the model except for the auto-incrementing ID
- Generate the relationships inside the Model file based on the given foreign keys
- Generate an `API Resource Controller` using the [controller.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/controller.mdc) rule
- Add the generated controller in the `/routes/api.php` as a `Route::apiResource`

# When creating a new Model in the `app/Models` folder
- Make sure the artisan command has the `-m` flag to create the necessary migration files too
- Make sure you generate a Seeder file for this model, and populate it with necessary information
- Make sure the Seeder file is called in the [DatabaseSeeder.php](mdc:database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php)
