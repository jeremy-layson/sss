# To create a proper seeder file follow these rules:
- When creating dummy data or mock data, use Faker PHP as defined in https://fakerphp.org/formatters/
- Use laravel's built-in function `fake()` to call a faker instance instead of declaring a `Faker\Factory::create()`
- For passwords always default them to "password"
